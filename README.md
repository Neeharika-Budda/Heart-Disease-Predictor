Heart Disease Predictor

Project Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on health indicators such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type. A Logistic Regression model is used for accurate and interpretable classification.

Implementation Details
1. Data Collection
   >Dataset: Heart Disease dataset (UCI).
   
   >Features: Age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG, heart rate, exercise-induced angina, etc.
2. Data Preparation
   >Missing values imputed.
   
   >Features standardized using StandardScaler.
3. Model Training
   >Algorithm: Logistic Regression.
   
   >Split: 80% training, 20% testing.
   
   >Model fitted on training data.
4. Evaluation
   >Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
   >Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning applied.
5. Tools and Libraries
   >Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy.
   >matplotlib, seaborn for visualization.
   >Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook as environment.

   
Aim and Significance
The aim is to enable early detection of heart disease for better patient care. This project contributes toward developing automated diagnostic tools that support healthcare professionals.
